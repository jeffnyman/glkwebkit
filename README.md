# GlkWebKit

This project is a library that is based on the [Glk API](https://www.eblong.com/zarf/glk/) and the [GlkOte](https://www.eblong.com/zarf/glk/glkote.html) interface library. The goal of this project is to combine a web-based interface (WebGlk) and a JavaScript-based implementation of the C-based Glk implementation (GlkJS).
